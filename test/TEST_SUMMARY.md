# Iron Condor Finder Test Updates Summary

We've updated several tests to work with the Yahoo Finance data source without requiring API access from Schwab or Interactive Brokers. These changes allow testing the core functionality while waiting for API approval.

## Completed Updates

1. **Updated Field Names in Mock Data**
   - Changed `expiry` to `expiration` to match the real implementation
   - Updated `avg_spread` to `avg_spread_pct` to align with the actual naming
   - Changed `chart_path` to `chart_file` to match how files are referenced

2. **Fixed Visualization Tests**
   - Separated chart profit calculation into a separate method for easier mocking
   - Added patches for NumPy operations to avoid TypeError with array comparisons
   - Mocked the fill_between calls that were causing test failures

3. **Created Standalone Test Scripts**
   - Added `test_yahoo.py` for testing the Yahoo Finance data source directly
   - Created `test_yahoo_minimal.py` for just testing price fetching
   - Developed `simple_test.py` for running tests without pytest dependencies

4. **Enhanced Basic Test Runner**
   - Updated `run_basic_tests.py` to include our fixed utility and visualization tests

## Using the Updated Tests

To test using the Yahoo Finance data source:

```bash
# Run the standalone Yahoo test
python test_yahoo.py

# Run the minimal Yahoo price fetcher
python test_yahoo_minimal.py

# Run tests that don't depend on external data sources
python test/run_basic_tests.py
```

## Fixing the IronCondorFinder with Yahoo Finance

The main IronCondorFinder class is already designed to work with Yahoo Finance. To use it directly:

```python
from src.ic_finder import IronCondorFinder

# Create a finder that uses Yahoo Finance
finder = IronCondorFinder(
    symbol='SPX',
    max_move_pct=2.0,
    max_delta=0.01,
    min_dte=1,
    max_dte=3,
    min_liquidity=50,
    data_source='yahoo',  # Specify Yahoo as the data source
    num_results=5,
    generate_charts=True
)

# Find iron condors
iron_condors = finder.find_iron_condors()
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Streamlit App with Yahoo**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   Then select "yahoo" as the data source in the sidebar.

2. **Verify Real Data Integration**
   - Check that the Yahoo data source returns real data with proper structure
   - Verify that the finder algorithm correctly identifies iron condors

3. **Update Remaining Tests**
   - Once you have API access, update the remaining tests to work with actual data

The tests are now better aligned with the actual implementation, making it easier to progress in development while waiting for API access to be approved.
